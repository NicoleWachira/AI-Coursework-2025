This insight is about Income distribution analysis it shows the distribution of customers across different income brackets From the graph generated, most customers are of upper- middle class income of a range 60-90k, few luxury customers of above 120k,low income customers of range 0 to 30k, middle class from 30 to 60k and upper income from 90 to 120k.From the output the mall attracts a high number of 86 customers in the upper- middle class category. Meaning the mall can focus on premium but accessible brands and should introduce discounts for lower income customers. the mall can also introduce premiumum loyalty programe with exclusive benefits.\n",

        "**INSIGHT 2** How do they shop? This insight shows the spending score categories or the spending behaviour categories. it shows how freely customers spend regardless of income and distribution of spending habits across all cuatomers.of which we have 75 customers in the 40 to 60 spending range meaning this is the core customer base of the mall since they are consistent and relaible spenders hence the mall can focus on mid range products that appeal to the 40 to 60 spending range. then it can also feature products in the $30-90 price range. then they can have loyalty programs and mid-week shopping events for consistent shoppers. In otherwords the mall should cater heavily on the 40 to 60 spending segment but shouldnt ignore the high spenders as they bring in more revenue or premium revenue. it should also clear pathways for low spenders\n",

        "**INSIGHT 3** This insight is about gender distributions and spending patterns. So it show that females spend more with an average of 51.5 spending score while men spend slitghtly less than the women with an average of 48.5 spending score. In this case the mall can have more stores for like cosmetics, clothes etc that appeal to females. it could also create promotions to increase male spending like having sports bar specials, grooming and gaming nights etec"
